export const dateFrom = new Date('2010-01-01T00:00:00+0000')

I'm a Product Manager with <time time={dateFrom}
title={`I've worked in Product Management roles since ${format(dateFrom, 'MMM yyyy')}`}>{calcLengthInYears(dateFrom,
dateTo)}</time> of experience building internal platforms and B2B SaaS products. I enjoy teamwork,
spending time with customers, and taking products from idea to reality, especially 0→1 products that
deliver clear, practical value.

For the last decade, I've focused on data platforms and workflow tools for advertising agencies.
I've applied AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI technologies to real-world product challenges,
including optimisation, automation, and analytics, always with a focus on impact over hype.

I've also contributed to the core technology behind two businesses, a scale-up and a start-up, both
acquired for their technology.
