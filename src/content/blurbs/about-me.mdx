export const dateFrom = new Date('2010-01-01T00:00:00+0000')

I am a Product Manager with over <time time={dateFrom}
title={`I've worked in Product Management roles since ${format(dateFrom, 'MMM yyyy')}`}>{calcLengthInYears(dateFrom,
dateTo)}</time> of experience, primarily in internal platforms and B2B SaaS applications. I enjoy
teamwork, meeting customers and building 0-1 products and capabilities to support them. During the
last ten years of my career, I have focused on data platforms and workflow tools for Advertising
Agencies. I'm proud to have contributed to the technology assets of two businesses, both acquired
for their technology assets: a Scale-Up and a Start-Up.
