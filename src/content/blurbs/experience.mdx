I work for [Acorn Intelligence](https://acorn-i.com/), an eCommerce and advertising agency that
supports brands in growing their revenue from Amazon, Walmart, and Direct-to-Consumer channels. I am
their [Lead Product Manager](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/product-management-hierarchy/),
responsible for [Ignite](https://ignite.acorn-i.com/), our proprietary analytics and workflow
platform customers and colleagues use to supercharge their work.

Previously, I was a Senior Product Manager at
[The Exchange Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-exchange-lab/about/), a
[WPP](https://www.wpp.com/) company. WPP acquired The Exchange Lab for our proprietary Programmatic
Advertising technology,
[Proteus](https://www.wpp.com/news/2015/12/groupm-acquires-programmatic-marketing-solutions-company-the-exchange-lab).
Before that, I was a Product Manager at [Ask.com](https://uk.ask.com).
