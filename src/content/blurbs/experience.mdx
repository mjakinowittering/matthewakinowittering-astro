title: My experience
---

I'm the Lead Product Manager at [Acorn Intelligence](https://acorn-i.com/), an eCommerce and
advertising agency helping brands grow across Amazon, Walmart, and direct-to-consumer channels. I
own [Ignite](https://ignite.acorn-i.com/), our proprietary analytics and workflow platform used by
customers and internal teams to support and scale their work.

My role includes applying AI and Machine Learning to improve performance and efficiency, and
exploring how Generative AI can enhance analysis and decision-making at scale.

Previously, I was a Senior Product Manager at
[The Exchange Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-exchange-lab/about/), a
[WPP](https://www.wpp.com/) company acquired for its programmatic advertising technology,
[Proteus](https://www.wpp.com/news/2015/12/groupm-acquires-programmatic-marketing-solutions-company-the-exchange-lab).
Earlier in my career, I was a Product Manager at [Ask.com](https://uk.ask.com), working on
large-scale, data-driven products in search and content.
